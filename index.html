                <h2>Baskin Robbins</h2>
                <p>Our first couple adventures were to Baskin Robbins at Wolfchase and Cordova. It was ice cream, but we wanted something more. So to get out of our friendly confines near work, we started to branch out.</p>

                <h2>Jerry's Sno Cones</h2>
                <p>A future trip took us to Jerry's on Wells Station Road. Who ever thought of ice cream with a finely ground sno cone was genious!</p>

                <h2>La Michoacana</h2>
                <p>This was an adventure for sure! I had a banana split for $3.50. My teammates enjoyed fruit popsicles. Unfortunately, we were stuck in 2 hour gridlock back to the office.</p>

                <h2>Area 51</h2>
                <p>I suggested this place after a recent visit to Crosstown. Truly good local ice cream!</p>

                <h2>The Levee Creamery</h2>
                <p>We headed to the new ice cream place that opened in Highland Row. Another quality experience!</p>
